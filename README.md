This is the codebase for the World of Darkness 13, a build of a fork of a downstream of a-- in any case...

We are based on the Paradox Interactive World of Darkness(c) gamelines, with administrative oversight determining what we add to our game. Please see below for our guides on contributing.

## Attribution: tgstation
## The vast majority of our code was written by the maintainers and members of the /tg/station community up to February 3rd, 2021. We regularly pull and port features from /tg/station as well. We would like to officially recognize and pay our respect to the thousands of development hours that created the foundation and continue to create the function of our server.
## Changes to the below files have taken place to amend references to /tg/station with our own where appropriate. These changes are not intended and should not be interpreted as any attempt to inappropriately misattribute credit for the efforts of the original developers, maintainers, artists, or community managers.
## The commit for the point at which we diverged from /tg/station:

## Compilation

**The quick way**. Find `bin/server.cmd` in this folder and double click it to automatically build and host the server on port 1337.

**The long way**. Find `bin/build.cmd` in this folder, and double click it to initiate the build. It consists of multiple steps and might take around 1-5 minutes to compile. If it closes, it means it has finished its job. You can then [setup the server](.github/guides/RUNNING_A_SERVER.md) normally by opening `tgstation.dmb` in DreamDaemon.

**Building tgstation in DreamMaker directly is deprecated and might produce errors**, such as `'tgui.bundle.js': cannot find file`.
